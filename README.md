# C_exercises
My first programming exercises in the beginning of my academic studies (Introduction to Computer Science course)
and my Operating Systems course exercises (more complicated exercises from the 2nd year of my studies).

*************************************************************************************
Each directory contains one exercise. The input and output requirements are detailed in a pdf file.
In order to test an exercise, please download the repository and open the chosen directory.
Then compile the program. You can do it automatically in Linux OS by the makefile attached in the directory 
(Just open the command line terminal of Linux in the chosen directory and enter the command 'make').
Then executable file "a.out" has to be created (you can run it by the command './a.out').
Good luck!
